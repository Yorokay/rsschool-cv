## **Code Example**
Spin Around, Touch the Ground from [сodewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/kata/65127141a5de2b1dcb40927e) - Given a list of directions to spin, "left" or "right", return an integer of how many full 360° rotations were made. Note that each word in the array counts as a 90° rotation in that direction.
```
function spinAround(turns) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < turns.length; i++) {
    if (turns[i] === 'right') {
      result += 90;
    } else {
      result -= 90;
    }
  }
  return Math.floor(Math.abs(result) / 360);
}
